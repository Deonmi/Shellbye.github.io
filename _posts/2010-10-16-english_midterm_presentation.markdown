Hello ladies and gentlemen  
  
My name is jack bai. And I am 20 years old, during the last 20 years in my life, I have been asked many times what my dream is, and each time I gave them the same answer “I will change the world”. Hearing this, most people will have two different reactions. One is just laught and said that when they were young they alse have the same dream, but when they grew up they changed it by finding a good job or something likely. I think this is why there are so little people finally changed the world somehow, most of us just gave up the original dream without having a try. The others instead will ask why. There comes another answer of mine “I love this world very much, but it had something that I don’t like, so I will change it and make it more beautiful”.  
  
Then no more quertions. But I have to ask myself “how?”  
  
The answer is start a company.  
  
First of all, I want you know that how lucky you guys are , because you all have the opportunity to see the my company, see the future of the world!  
  
As it is known to us all, 10,000 years ago, we human hunt animals and have to work very hard. And the work itself is a risk because the animal we hunt may be hungrier than we and they will hunt us too! What a bad news!  
  
But later on, 6,000 years ago, things started to change, we learned to grow things to eat, and this is easier than hunting and we don’t worry about be eaten by animals, that’s why learning is important and that’s why we go to college!  
  
In the later 5,000 years, things didn’t change very much. But 200 years ago, the start of The Industrial Revolution changed everying. Machine started to do the most job and so we human can have some rest after work for nearly 10,000 years. Machine release the hunman being from the physical work, and leave us more time to focus on the mental ones.  
  
Then you may ask “what is the next?”. Good question! Because the answer I will give to this question is my company, the Oxygen Science. Our slogan is “Born to change”.And the follow picture is our company's logo——idea came from me and my classmate Mr Li Xintao made it for me.
