   Yesterday I send her a message ask if she have a boyfriend , and her answer is "I have got someone who I like and I am sure that he liked me,too." Well, to tell the truth, this isn't the answer I want but it is a answer so I have to face it.Maybe it's a good thing,at least I won't be upset when I saw her talking to some other boy.  
  
She reminded me of Hao Wenting, they have some common characteristics. I haven't connected with Hao for nearly three monthes, and I don't know if that day finally come will she connect me first if I didn't connect her. I am afraid that she will never do that.  
  
About Dujia, I have come to her personal website sometime to see what happened to her in the past day. Recently, or just two days ago, I listen to the song <亲人>, and to my surprise, I didn't feel any sad angmore, does that mean that I have completely out of that feeling? That seems to be a good thing to me , but why I am not happy? Maybe that king of be grown up isn't what I want. Because that means nothing but a cold-hearted boy.  
  
When I saw the movie <**The Lady of the Camellias>, this question occur to me : why the boys pursue to the girls but not the opposite? Do the boys always more thirsty than the girl? Why should I always be the active one while the girls always have the right to chooser? I think that should be changed because I'm tired of pursue the girls.
