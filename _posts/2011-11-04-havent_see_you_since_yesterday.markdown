Haven't see you since yesterday  
Where are you now?   
Are you happy like I wished,  
Or alone like I am?  
  
Haven't see you since yesterday  
Can you feel my missing now?  
How I wish I could tell you I love you,  
But I can't, 'cause the history hurts me.   
  
Haven't see you since yesterday  
And the image of you are killing me.  
I hope I can hold your hand,  
And ring it with all my heart.
