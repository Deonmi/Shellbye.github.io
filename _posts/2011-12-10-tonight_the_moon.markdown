I thought I was dead already  
I thought I would be gone forever  
I thought I would be forgotten  
I thought I should vanished  
  
Untill I saw the Moon,tonight  
Untill I saw warmth, I saw hope  
which I once thought I don't deserve  
which I once dare not to persue  
  
She is right there in front of me  
Soft and bright  
Her image disappeared in the air  
Hid above the cloud  
  
Tonight, I was saved by the Moon  
Tomorrow, I will fight for mine own  
Only by staring at her can I   
Obtain the inner peace
