It's said that when you're not using your mother  language, you'll feel safe. And that's why I wrote this in English. To  tell the truth, I didn't spent anytime in English learning this term,  how pathetic since that's all because I didn't have any English relevant  course! Time is really limited,isn't it? You have to spent your  precious time in the thing that really counts but the thing you deeply  love.

  


Man  can always learn much more in difficlut time. Well, you tell me. Have  been through such a hard time, I really changed a lot. I didn't use the  word "grow" because I do not think that kind of growing but adapting.  Yes, adapt to the rules and the rules and the rules. It's not a bad  thing anyhow, actually, now I agreed that there is no such thing that  can be defined as good or bad.

  


Talk  about time, I didn't realise the importance of it untill lacking of it.  It's said that you'll only spent you time on the person you really  cares, because in that case, the life of you two are combined. That  means when someone may prefer to give you his money than his time, it's  may be signal that you're not that important to him. It may make sense  when you are waiting, as far as I know, that the right way to spent your  time in someone else which I do not recommend.

  


There  are so many odd ideas that just popping out in my mind everyday and  night, and then lead my thought into somewhere I don't know. Such as, I  suddenly what to know what shall I do when one day I wake up and find  that I lost many things, like I cannot play basketball anymore, and I  can not understand what the excellent movie what to tell. Yes, that's  what may strike my mind sometime. Sometime it's full of fun while  sometime it's not. The really problem, if it is a problem, is that it is  out of my control. As a human being, especially the the man, we all  know what's that mean when it's out of control.

  


The  pain worship is something I didn't understand, it can not be explained  by evolution theory. Well, is it a Stockholm syndrome for all the human  in case of they can not hold the pain? Well, anyway, tough as it is, I  enjoy my life now.?
