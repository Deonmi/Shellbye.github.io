Each time I don't have a good mood, I write it away in English. I really hope it will help this time because it's killing me now. In the classroom, I tried my best to stop thinking and focus on the maths tests but it turned out to be in vain.  
  
The funny part of this time is that it's not me who bring it out but a odd dream. Ever since that, my mind was full and refused to accept anything else. I tried to watch a movie to forget it as usual, but the moive I choosed was all about a man whose wife is dying and it's full of the pain which I had now.  
  
I once heard a sentence says that the time when your heart is full of secret is the time your diary become a running account. It's true for me at least. Recently I happened find my diary in my drawer and I find that the last diary I write with my pen not the keyboard was in August 2011. It's really a pity for me since I once wrote it daily, like my father did decades ago.  
  
It's a good news for you when you're upset that your bro is upset too. Well, you cannot blame me for that, cause it's really comforable to know that. Like Harvey Dent once said, _fair enough._
