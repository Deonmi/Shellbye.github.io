I love this kind of pain, pure and quiet. You can not enjoy it if you did not devote into it. The funny part of this is that when you do devote into it, the most unwanted thing is to get out which will bring the pain in your chest, pure and quiet. Sophisticated, right? Well, let me put it this way, it can make it much easier: they say no pains, no gains, and what i mean up there is no gains, no pains.

  


I want to write my pain down immediately cause I know when I went to sleep and wake up an other day, all of this will gone. First of all, it's the shock. It came wich no doubt, and hit both the chest and brain. When it's done with that, there is full of cold sweat on the back and then stomach is involved, too. Here comes the sigh means that the regret wins. Well, now here goes the most interesting part, you start to notice that you can barely hear anything and you are losing your view.

  


So what do you do then? I sit down into the chair and write it down. Anyway, it's a sweet dream.
