To my dear parents, to the one I loved, and to myself.  
There is a moment that you suddenly noticed you are all alone in the world with no one around you.  
  
There is a day that you start to knew there is not so many persons who cares about you.  
  
There is a night that you have to face the darkness all by your owe with the wind crying outside  
  
There is a period that you finally realised life do harm you and it really hurt.
